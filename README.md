# Canugra Homebase
A collection of notebooks 

[Australia Coverage](https://github.com/bwlambert/CanungraHomebase/blob/master/AustraliaCoverage.ipynb)
---
Generating WKT polygons along a uniform grid, we characterize temporal frequency of WorldView2 and WorldView3 imaging across the entirety of Australia.

[Batemans Bay](https://github.com/bwlambert/CanungraHomebase/blob/master/BatemansBay.ipynb)
---
Comparisons of imagery featuring putative blooming events in 2016 with imagery subsequent to the blooming events.  Discovery of a large blooming event from May 2018. All locations in and around Batemans Bay, NSW.    

[Bloom Investigation](https://github.com/bwlambert/CanungraHomebase/blob/master/BloomInvestigation.ipynb)
---
Further investigation of the blooming event south of Batemans Bay, NSW, in May 2018. Features comparison of DigitalGlobe and Planet Labs imagery with respect to ability to capture visual detail of the bloom. Also includes (probable) aerial imagery.       

[Eucalypt Stands Brazil](https://github.com/bwlambert/CanungraHomebase/blob/master/EucalyptStandsBrazil.ipynb)
---
Characterization of Datt's ECARR index behavior on a commerical eucalypt stand in Brazil.

[Eucalyptus Sensing Canugra](https://github.com/bwlambert/CanungraHomebase/blob/master/EucalyptusSensingCanugra.ipynb)
---
Initial attempt to examine the eucalypt forest near the Canungra homebase described in Giles _et al._ (2018)

[Fixing ECARR Calculation](https://github.com/bwlambert/CanungraHomebase/blob/master/FixingECARR.ipynb)
---
Examining differences in alternative ECARR implementations.

[New Blooms](https://github.com/bwlambert/CanungraHomebase/blob/master/NewBlooms.ipynb)
---
Visual confirmation of blooms near Lismore in 2018.  

[PlanetLabs Brazil](https://github.com/bwlambert/CanungraHomebase/blob/master/PlanetLabsBrazil.ipynb)
---
Comparing Planet Labs 4-band imagery to the Digital Globe imagery from the commercial eucalypt stand investigated above.

[PlanetLabs Canungra](https://github.com/bwlambert/CanungraHomebase/blob/master/PlanetLabsCanungra.ipynb)
---
Investigation of Planet Labs 4-band imagery. Establishes ability of modified ECARR formulat to distinguish eucalypts.  

[WorldView3 Test](https://github.com/bwlambert/CanungraHomebase/blob/master/WorldView3Test.ipynb)
---
Documenting DigitalGlobe imagery ordering process, seasonality of imagery availability, and ECARR utility near Canungra.
